# Java-Bootcamp

This is a repository for all the codes I did while doing the Coding Blocks' 'CRUX Java' Bootcamp. 
These are all java files for:
-searching and sorting algorithms
-recursion 
-time and space complexity problems
-dynamic and object-oriented programming 
-linked lists
-generic trees
-binary trees
-hash tables
-heaps and graphs
-Tries[prefix trees]
